Here are the data for the project: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 


The script run_analysis.R downloads and extracts the zipped UCI HAR Dataset.

Then two included sub-datasets, a training dataset and a test data set, are seperately read and subject and activity information is added as two additional 
	variables for each observaition.

Activity labels are converted from numeric coded values to descriptive character values.

The two datasets are then combined into a single set of all of the observations for all subjects.

Column names are then loaded from the dataset and added to this dataframe.

This dataset is then reduced to only the columns for mean and standard deviation measurements.

Finally, the data is summarized into the mean of each variable for each combination of subject and activity.

This tidy dataset is then saved as "bysubjectandlabel.txt" to the working directory, and my be read using read.table()
