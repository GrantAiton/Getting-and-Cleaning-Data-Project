README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  

This Repo contains the R script run_analysis.R which downloads the large UCI HAR Dataset gathered from mobile phone motion sensors, and
extracts a tidy data set which summarizes this data based on the test subject and the activity performed.

The file CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and all transformations that the script run_analysis.R performs to
extract the summarized dataset from the larger dataset.
